# Phone Case

1. I started a new design on Onshape.
2. I started a sketch on the top plane for easier conversion to 2D later.
3. I wrote my initials with the text tool and extruded them.
4. I pressed the + icon and picked create drawing. After that I picked all of the studio and generated.
5. I deleted everything other than my initials and exported the drawing with svg format.
6. I sent the file to hisar3D, downloaded it and opened it on the xTool app.
7. I auto framed on the app by opening and closing the lid of the machine.
8. I set the material from library, found the same case I owned under silicone.
9. After that I picked engrave and selected a type of engrave from the sets that were already included under the selected material.
10. I had to use the offset tool on the app because on my design weirdly it made the width of the horizontal lines 0 meaning they don’t exist. This is probably also the error I had when it didn’t print my logo on the rulers.
11. I used offset, picked inside and outside for 1mm. It automatically generated the offset. I deleted my old design and kept the offset since it was better. Also I picked the blue light laser setting because Emre said it was more suitable and less dangerous.
12. I sent the file to the machine, opened its ventilator and started printing.
13. It came out perfect and I learned how to use a new machine, use the offset tool and modify designs on the xTool app.
14. I also downloaded the offset version and stored it on my computer.
