## Keychain Design

1. I have known Onshape since i am in the 3D class so there Is not anything I have learned.
2. I started a new document and then created 2 sketches in shapes of keychain.
3. Then I picked the text tool and put my name on there.
4. Then I created the chain part a circle by sketch.
5. I created a smaller circle and removed it while extraditing it.
6. Now my 3D keychain with my name on it was ready.

## The Bird Feeder Project:

1. Today I was given the task of creating a 3D bird feeder on onshape.
2. I opened up Onshape signed in and pressed create then new document.
3. After doing that I started creating the sketch parts of the bird feeder.
4. I modified the width and the height to the wanted numbers.
5. I converted the sketches which are 2D to 3D.
6. I checked the width and height just incase to see if I have made any mistake and if they were on the preferred cm’s.
7. To note ı did this before the digital fabrication lessons since I was given permission to add the project I did in 3D class because it was the same project even better and more challenging.
8. I know how to convert to 3D, removing items or adding them together or modifying depth and a lot more.
9. I didn't really learn any new stuff since we are using Onshape which i am good at because of 3D lessons I have every week.
10. I only learned how to download a design with the preferred format to put it here on notion.

This is the project file downloaded in the preferred format.

To download a design you constructed on Onshape you need to use the bar on the bottom right click and press export.

Then you need to pick the format you want the file to be in and you're done.

## Cake Project:

1. I watched the video on classroom and started designing the product.
2. I couldn't finish it in the design fabrication lesson so I continued it in 3D lesson today.
3. I used various of new shapes that I haven't tried before and learned how those shapes Are modified.
4. I used a lot of new tools, by tools I mean stuff like transform to face or fillet or move to or material.
5. It took a long time because of all the new tools I have learned and also it had many details that had to be made 1 by 1.
6. To summarize I had a lot of help, learned a lot of new tools and shapes usages and it took a long time because of all the details.
7. I also learned by myself while I was experimenting how to change the color of the faces of the designs.
8. Lastly while I was designing the bird feeder I have learned how to download with a specific type (the preferred one in classroom .3mf) so I did that and put it up on notion.
9. I have learned a lot on Onshape and I am going to teach it in the coding-summit at Hisar School.

## 16 Faced Dice Project:

1. I watched the video
2. While making this design I learned tools like construct and plane that was new.
3. I had known mirror before before but construct helps you design more detailed and easier. 
4. İn the other hand plane helps you make new designing sets, its like creating a new floor for designing.
5. I have also learned how to download new tools from the public market while downloading the 3D line tool, I noticed the tools from the market could not be perfect since the 3D line tool didn't have hide option.
6. I also learned how to use circular shape creator which makes the surface that it was put onto symmetrical. 
7. Then I downloaded it with the .3mf format and took screenshot.
8. I had learned how to download before which is from export button.
9. I had learned a lot with this project, new tools, how to get other tools and a lot more.

## **Elephant Project:**

1. I opened the given document.
2. I created a copy of the given document so I could see the design better.
3. By looking at the document while doing my design I could check every distance and every radius or every constraint. 
4. By looking at the constraint there was no way I couldn't do the same design.
5. I learned how to use the helix tool while doing this design.
6. I finished the design and then downloaded the 3mp version.
7. This project taught me how to use the helix tool only because I knew all of the other tools already. 
8. By doing this project my efficiency improved on Onshape and I became faster while using it.

## Variable **Dimensioning**

1. I opened The classroom and saw that we needed to learn variables.
2. I opened youtube and searched how do variables work on Onshape.
3. I watched the first minute of the video and learned that variables are just letters that were given a number and a type of length like inch or cm.
4. I opened Onshape and created a new document.
5. Now from the first minute of the video ı have learnt that we had to set up all the variables we are going to use before using them or else it wont work, so I started setting up different lengths and heights for the parts of the sketch. 
6. I named them armLengthX and headHeightY etc.
7. After that by looking at the picture provided in the assignment I started sketching.
8. This time when setting up dimensions instead of using numbers I used variables.
9. Then I extruded these sketches and finished my design.
10. Lastly I took an screenshot, exported in 3mf. form and generated a link so I could add them to the notion site.
11. While doing this project I learned that variables in Onshape are values that allows you to control the sizes in the design so changing one value automatically updates the whole model without having to change everything manually.

## Basic Matryoshka Toy:

1. I did intense thinking and tried to come out with the best toy I could design.
2. I opened onshape and started a new document.
3. I created 1 10x10 circle and made it height 10cm, then I made it 3D.
4. İ created another circe with the same width and height but I decreased 0.5 cm from them.
5. İ extraverted the second design and pressed remove it creating a hole. 
6. I created another sketch with the same width and height but made it so it fits in the hole like a matryoshka doll.
7. I checked and fixed the height to be 10x10 I made sure of that and checked if it was parametric which it was.
8. I saved my new design called matryoshka doll demo.
