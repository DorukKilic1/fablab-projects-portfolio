# 17 Cm Ruler For Lab

1. While working for any of my projects I noticed that there wasn't enough rulers in the lab that I needed to use. It was hard for people to finish their projects and it took more time for them because they had to share the ruler between themselves.
2. I thought about printing some rulers through the laser printer for people to use, then I found some files on the web in SVG form and tested them but it didn't work because the files I printed were badly designed and also there was another reason of the xToolP3 machine being broken. 
3. I first tried printing small shapes in order to test the machine in different values of speed and power. After some testing I found the correct values for the broken machine and noted them on a post-it for others to use before the machine went through maintenance. Also it is important to mention that testing small shapes was efficient for saving material.
4. After that I went on Onshape and started designing my own ruler, I first wanted to make it 30 cm but incase of any errors while printing I had to lower the length of the ruler to 17 cm in order to avoid wasting material. 
5. I finished my design, created a drawing from it and then sent it to the machine for printing.
6. I tested 1 ruler first incase of anything unexpected happening.
7. After printing I noticed that I made a mistake, instead of increasing the height only I increased everything because I selected everything while trying to only select height to increase it making the measurement off real values. İn order to fix that mistake I undid my change of increasing the height and printed 1 again.
8. The ruler came out without any unexpected mistakes so went back to the prepare page, duplicated the design and printed again.
9. I printed multiple rulers at the end, they came out perfect and ready to use for any measurements.
