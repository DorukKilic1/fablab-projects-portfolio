# Lemon DoDo

## Day 1:

1. I have just officially finished the lemon fish robot and I wanted to create my own personal lemon robot. I got permission from the teacher and started brainstorming.
2. I wanted the lemon bot to be based on the legendary ancient animal that’s called “DoDo Bird” instead of the usual and boring fish.
3. I searched for an reference picture. It had to be basic and made by lines or else it would take a lot longer for me to modify.
4. After a long search I decided on using this picture and now I need to recreate the picture  based on the image in my mind.

***The Reference Picture.***

## Day 2:

1. I opened up a new document on Onshape and created a new sketch on the top plane.
2. I added the image on that sketch and renamed it “DoDo Image”. I did it this way in order to see the image clearly even if i wasn’t on the same sketch and also to make it unaffected from everything else. 
3. I created a new sketch called “Leg” on the same plane and tried to use the line tool on top of the drawings lines but after finishing that the design didn’t have any angled lines making the design look bad. 
4. After deleting that design I tried recreating the image with using the spline tool but that also came out futile because a spline needs to end on itself or else it disappears meaning it gets deleted. I deleted this design too.
5. Then I used the 3 point arc tool with the line tool mixed with a little amount of sketch fillets making it look a lot better. Also this time instead of using the images lines for accuracy to the image I closed the image and sketched from my memory making it look a lot less uncanny. I learnt that being accurate to the image made it look uncanny because I wanted to make the base straight instead of angled so it could stay upright. This was a big improvement but the design still didn’t meet my expectations so I’m going to try again the next day.

***The Leg Sketch’s Prototype.***

## Day 3:

1. I perfected the leg sketch with repositioning the feet dots and then duplicated it for the second feet part.
2. I opened a new sketch and started sketching the wings but this time I had experience so I did it easier. I used the spline tool and slowly went over the image. I learnt that going over the image didn’t work as good as I thought it would so I repositioned the points of the spline based on the output I get after extruding it. I did this until the design met my expectations and then duplicated the wing to have another one. 
3. For the torso I did the same method but I had to change a lot of points because I used more of them. The reason why I used more is that if you have more dots changing 1 dot effects less. After that I extruded it and finished the sketch.
4. I repositioned all the sketches on the top plane since thats where I designed all of them and now I just have to make a plan on how to modify this sketch until it looks like lemon. 
5. I realized that ı needed to add holes, and connection parts so after the design is printed the parts can be combined. For perfection I need to measure a lot of stuff like motors, screws, screw ends etcetera. Since I cant continue this from home I need to continue it at the lab.

## Day 4:

1. I opened the design again, used the transform tool to rotate and reposition in order for the whole design to fit in the plane.
2. I measured the holes in a finished lemon and it came out 3mm while the screws were 2.5mm.
3. I modified the designs and added screw holes to them while making sure that their duplicates were identical after. In order to do this I edited each part individually, deleted their duplicate, added the required 3mm holes to the one left and remade the deleted sketch by duplicating the new version of it.
4. I did this for all of the sketches and documented my progress.

***Design With Added Screw Holes.***

1. I realized I had to sketch some drawings in real life to figure out how to connect the parts since the design I created doesn’t have straight lines like lemon. I shall start sketching tomorrow.

## Day 5:

1. I made plans on how the parts will connect and the motor too. The wings will move and the parts will connect by the same way how the lemon connects. I design a connector piece and printed it.
2. I also modified the design fusing the leg and the body sketch together in order for the robot to look better and stand on its legs.

***Can Helping Me.***

1. After printing I checked if the motor could fit and if the holes were working for the screws.
2. I also didn’t have any issues with printing because the machine was fixed, I cleaned up the machine after use for others.
3. The connector piece fit without any problems but it was too short so now I have to increase its length from the design which I will do tomorrow.
