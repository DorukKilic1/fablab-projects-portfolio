# XToolP3 Pins

1. While learning how to operate xToolP3 It had come to my understanding that one of the four pins that was supposed to hold the material while printing was broken and coudn’t hold like it was supposed to.
2. I started researching what that part was called.
3. After a while I learnt that it was called xToolP3 honeycomb pin and ussually contained magnets that ours didin’t have.
4. I searched for a file of that pin all through the internet and this was the hardest part since only a little amount of people really broke their pins or would just buy new ones.
5. Lastly I found the file in the 3.Mf format and printed it after first importing it on Onshape and adjusting the design to match our common wood thickness (1/4cm) .
6. I printed 1 of the pins before all of them because I wanted to make sure that it was fit for common materials that are used in the lab.
7. I printed the rest a total of 8 pins and gave them to the teacher.
